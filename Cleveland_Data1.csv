We are on our last stretch of schooling and Dr. Huska has more than enough knowledge to share with us to make us feel like we've learned something this rotation. Our rounds time is wasted by her ""ranting"" about matters irrelevant to chiropractic and our learning. Her first 20 minutes of rounds where she can ""check her emails"", is unnecessary and a waste of our time. That is 20 minutes that we could be learning something, or even self directed learning within our pod. It is incredibly frustrating to hear that CMT has approved these 20 minutes of every rounds day for her to waste our time. That's 60 minutes each week we automatically lose. Dr. Huska has amazing potential to be a great teacher. She has shown us that in small pieces, and she is a wonderful support system for us.

It is not hard to pick up on her negative body language (eye rolling, sighing, glare etc) which is not conducive to a positive learning environment and makes everyone not want to approach her for help, which is really the worst thing, especially when dealing with patients. It would be beneficial for her to remember that we are still learning, and that she was in our shoes once. I know that she is a competent and intelligent resident and I am sure that she is up to date with the research...which are all fine qualities to have in a clinician. What is more valuable to me, is how I am spoken to, how I am taught and if I feel I am in a comfortable learning environment; which she never creates. I do not appreciate being spoken to the way I was spoken to and I felt there was a lack of respect. I do not think it is a positive thing to have a clinician that everyone dreads encountering, especially when there is something bigger going on: the care of the patients. Yes, she has more experience than us and two more years of education, but when you break it down, we are all equals and she is not that far ahead of us. She was just recently an intern too, which I think she needs to remember and take into consideration when dealing with current interns, especially when she is placed in a respected position such as a clinician. I would have more respect for her if she treated others with respect, consideration, kindness and not in a condescending manner.

I have not witnessed but through pod mates have heard with providing feedback she rolls her eyes or will make comments that be little you as an intern. Hearing this and witnessing it makes me hesitate to approach her as a clinician. In addition one intern had a complex case in which the attending clinician was requiring the intern to perform extra work when the clinician stepped into the room stating that the shift ends in five minutes you need to hurry up as I have to leave. I feel as though this was inappropriate as we as interns are not paid to be an intern in general and stay past our working hours to get the job done as we are passionate and want to learn and not rush while the clinician is rushing the intern to finish the work for the day as the shift is almost done. Dr. Tavares has ingrained in us that we don't leave the clinic until all the patient work is done. I think this made the intern feel uneasy and rushed as she had some many questions for the clinician. This adds stress to the interns and doesn't create an environment to learn and grow.,kolesen

She advised a patient who had red flags to go to the emergency room if his symptoms worsened, however she made the huge mistake of not informing the patient of her suspicions regarding his health. When I questioned her as to why she did not inform the patient of her suspicions, she said she didn't want to scare him. This is an egregious mistake on her part, she did a diservice to the patient and showed lack of competence. Instead she went over sleep hygiene when clearly he was not well and to top things off she took him to the book store (after me telling her and she witnessing his swollen ankles, laboured breathing etc) to look for a pillow. When I approached her again asking her if I could call the patient to correct her mistake and tell him to go to the hospital, she discussed it with me briefly and then said she wanted to talk about it further before I call, so she told me to wait while she worked on checking SOAP notes. After 45 mins, I broached the subject again and literally asked to finish talking about the issue because it involves the patient's safety, she barked at me and said she see's me sitting there and to wait my turn. She was not doing anything that urgent, she just wanted to draw a line in the sand. Many other interns witnessed this and were astonished (as we usually are at her poor behaviour) and told me to tell CMT about it. In this case and other cases she refuses to deal with patients, instead choosing to avoid them at all costs. Dr. Huska has an inability to communicate effectively with patients and her interns. Patients have told me that they are on the verge of leaving her pod to go to a different clinician but they are scared of her. That is not good practice management. Patients should not fear their chiropractor. Dr. Huska creates a very negative learning environment which is oppressive and unprofessional to say the least. The sad part is that she is her only obstacle and lacks the ability to self reflect on her behaviour and make the changes necessary. She is constantly yelling at us for things we haven't done ""wrong"", mistakes we have not made etc. If we say anything, she tells us (she has said and done this to all of the interns, not just myself) we are sensitive, or argumentative. She mistakes our facial expressions for sensitivity when in fact it is total astonishment and disdain at her lack of professionalism, as well as the inappropriateness of her behaviour and comments. She is disrespectful to others and I think that is why she gets a feeling that we do not respect her; when in fact we are reacting to being so poorly treated by her. Dr. Huska wastes an enormous amount of time rambling and ranting about her personal problems and opinions that have no clinical relevance what so ever. As adults, we should have the choice to be subject to her angry diatribes and yet we are not allowed to speak, or leave the room during rounds - so basically we are made to sit there and take all of this negativity. She then has us do a meditation session on her iphone, which in and of it self becomes something for her to argue with us about. She argues constantly with us over every small detail just for the sake of creating negativity and conflict. She dumps all of the work of doing competency's on the resource clinicians. The resource has to allocate time to all three pods, but she literally tells us to go and take advantage of them, to have all cases prepared for them to go over. How can a resource go over 7 of my case narratives in one day? She spends so much time rambling and ranting during rounds that we get nothing done but then she wants the resources to do the work.",ohuska
